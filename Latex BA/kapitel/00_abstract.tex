\chapter*{Abstract}
In the field of model-driven software development, domain-specific languages can make an important contribution to the development of software systems. Nevertheless, their use is not widespread because the development of domain-specific tools is often considered complex and tedious. To show that the development of such tools can also be made possible with relatively little effort, the development process of such a tool is shown in this context. For the development, the \textsc{Cinco} Meta Tooling Suite is used, whose main feature is the full generation of graph-based modeling tools. SCCharts, a visual modeling language for the specification of safety-critical reactive systems, serves as a representative for a domain-specific graphical modeling language for which the tool is developed.
