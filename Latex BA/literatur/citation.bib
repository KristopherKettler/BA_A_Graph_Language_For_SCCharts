@article{Harel.1987,
 abstract = {We present a broad extension of the conventional formalism of state machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units. Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively, with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact and expressive---small diagrams can express complex behavior---as well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification. We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification of a particularly complex system.},

@article{Naujokat.2018,
 abstract = {Even with the help of powerful metamodeling frameworks, the development of domain-specific graphical modeling tools is usually a complex, repetitive, and tedious task, which introduces substantial upfront costs often prohibiting such approaches in practice. In order to reduce these costs, the presented Cinco meta tooling suite is designed to provide a holistic approach that greatly simplifies the development of such domain-specific tools. Our solution is based on the idea to apply the concept of domain specialization also to the (meta-)domain of ``domain-specific modeling tools''. Important here is our focus on complex graph-based models, comprising various kinds of nodes and edges together with their individual representation, correlations, and interpretation. This focus allows for high-level specifications of the model structures and functionalities as the prerequisite for push-button tool generation.},

Submissions are evaluated according to these goals. This book, the first volume in the series, contains contributions by the members of the editorial board. These contributions indicate the envisioned style and range of papers of topics covered by the transactions series. They cross-cut various traditional research directions and are characterized by a clear focus on change.},
